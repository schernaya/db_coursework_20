Smart Shopping List is about as dumb a Shopping List as can be. You cannot add or delete categories, you're stuck with whatever categories they seem fit to give you which are grocery based. If you're planning on using it for something like a hardware store and need Building Supplies, Electrical, Plumbing etc you're out of luck. You can't even add Quantity! Isn't that usually a basic feature of a shopping list?! So if you add Potatoes, how many? 5lbs? 1lbs? who knows."", 'I love this app, it looks stunning and clean which personally is important to me, and everything works smoothly as intended- setting reminders for tasks, repetition, notes, etc. One thing I\'d like is for ""subtasks"" to be able to appear on the main task page under the main task, maybe a button to toggle this. If there already is, I\'m not sure how to access it. Other than that, I\'m excited to use the app to be more organized.', 'I used to pay for premium for years. No more. This app has become so unreliable. It randomly reorders my daily tasks & listings - very frustrating. It drops tasks currently due to the someday category thus you do them last accidently... And, it the sync feature bites. If you use it at all use only the free version. At least your frustration will not cost you your hard earned money!', 'I am starting to hate this app! Every time they update, I start to have the exact same problem; I cannot edit/delete any of my events through any.do app. When I contact them about the issue, they just suggested me to check&uncheck my calendars and it was not helpful at all (even though I believe they really tried to help)! The problem went away magically at the first time but after an update, it came back now. Ugh, so annoying!', 'Was great; now not so much. I\'ve been using for years but a recent update makes it where when I\'m typing things, it\'ll just randomly highlight a word and remove it. It then randomly assigns it to date even though I pressed \'Today\'. It\'s infuriating. For example I typed ""Go Christmas shopping today"" and the program gave me ""Go shopping today"" and assigned it to December 25th. Obviously, that\'s not at all what I was shooting for. These recent updates are making the app much worse than before!', 'This was a 4-5 star app for me for years, but now since what appears to have happened during a major update in October, I can\'t give more than 3 stars. I\'m posting this here in the hopes that maybe others are experiencing the same issue, and that will prompt more serious investigation by the any.do staff. The issue I am seeing occurs when setting a reminder for a future date. Go thru the usual process, app records the reminder date/time correctly, then sometimes minutes, or even seconds later, the reminder shows up as a current task under ""today"". Its happening intermittently, but at least 50% of the time. I\'ve used any.do for several years, so I know its not a situation of not knowing how to use the app. Clearing data and cache and reinstalling has not helped. Any.do support is trying to help, wants a video, but I can\'t take a video of every time I set a reminder hoping to catch the issue. Its unrealistic. If anyone else using the app is experiencing this issue, please please please let Any.do support know. I won\'t discount its an issue specific to my device, but the fact that the app ran fine for years, until an update, has me thinking otherwise.', ""Nice but there are few things that make my experience difficut: 1. It's definitely inconvenient to drag task from one manu to another 2. No option to change the manues to be in parallel (like columns) or to change the titles 3. Web ui super small! You cannot see the big page at once (I really didnt understand why it's so small!) 4. No direct chat or support"", ""The app looks great but it's limited. You cannot add notes for specific days. You cannot add a calander unless you connect it to your email calander and the stake white color scheme can't be changed unless you buy premium. Which is about 18$ a year. I would love to see a daily note option with text editing allowed and the ability to add a calander without having to sync it with your Google calendar."", 'Liked Any.do at first, enough that I even signed up for premium so I could schedule reoccurring tasks. However, I soon learned that it doesn\'t interface with Google Calendars the way that it claims. Instead, you have to sign up for a 3rd party service called Zapier. The link never worked right. Anything I scheduled in Any.do would stay there and not sync. Initially my purchase receipt said ""cancel anytime,"" but now they won\'t refund the 10 months of service I haven\'t used. Left a bitter taste.', ""It's pretty complicated to get used to and not fast to use at all if you're doing more than adding s generic task... Annoyed that I subscribed for. YEAR thinking it would actually be able to synchronize with the popular apps I use but no. It only syncs with like, three, and you need some third party thing that you basically have to code yourself for other apps. Stupid. Not even worth the black Friday discount subscription price."", ""Great app. I was looking for an app that had to do lists, a calendar synced with Google's and a nice user interface. Easy to use and has a desktop app (even if it's not as good as the mobile one)."", ""I love this application so much!!! Good job to the developers. However, I've been having some issues lately with the application. The application refuses to notify me of some tasks I planned to do. When trying to set the time for a reminder, the clock's 5 minutes faster and automatically blocks the other minutes before. As an alternative, I set the date and time using natural language but sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Kindly fix this. Once again, it's a wonderful application."", ""I've used this app for many years with good experience. Lately the UX and complexity have caused some problems, nonetheless, new features have been very good. However, with the latest update I can no longer see tasks planned for tomorrow, a feature that was the reason for using this app to begin with. It's just gone with no possibility to configure it again. I do understand development of new features, but I do not appreciate removal of features that are being used. Great app, not for me anymore"", 'Love this app, but some functions make the productivity lacking. In my experience, there is a limited amount of notifications I can receive from this app per day. There appears to be no way to change this on the settings for my phone or the app. This is problematic for me, because I have the premium version and have it connected to Zapier. I am not receiving push notifications when actions are taking place. Very disappointing, as this is crucial for time management projects with teams.', ""Truly the best planning app! I was looking for a planning app with widgets that can change their size. Was harder than I thought! I love that you can see everythubg even in the smallest widget. That was very important to me. What I also like is that you can see all your tasks in a time line sorted by time. This way I don't miss anything. Subtasks and notes are helpful. I like the separate feature for the shopping list! This app is super flexible and intuitive!"", ""I have used this app for years, it is great if you want to be more organized and get reminders of the tasks you need to do. I must say however, that the app itself has regressed throughout the years with all the updates. Things used to be simple and intuitive, now I don't understand what half the buttons do, basic functions like deleting and removing tasks are way too clunky. The concept of the app is great but I can't recommend it anymore, each update makes it worse."", 'Easy to use. No ads on free version. Helps you to remember everything and has a lot of features on free version. Paid version takes it a step up and provides even better stuff for if you are busy intensive.', ""Great app, but don't want to pay a monthly fee for all the features I don't use. Please offer a one time fee to use a dark theme / mode, so your customers don't have to stare at a glaring white screen. White screens also use more battery power than dark ones, so it also drains your battery quicker. Just about everyone else is offering this option for free, so please offer it to your customers for a reasonable price too. Thank you."", ""Change in the calendar feature really made the experience worst :( It became more difficult to identify days with appointments because you have to click on each day and roll all the way down to see through the hours. Can you, please, fix this or return to the previous version? I really enjoy this app and I don't want to change to another one."", 'Great app. It would be good to see an easy integration with email clients as part of this. So we can grab emails to set them as tasks or assign them to team members who can then see their tasks natively in their email client, as well as in Any.do. Really good tool for reminders on a todo list.', ""My favorite To-Do app of 2020 I don't get why there are so many negative comments, the app is so beautifully designed and very easy to use. I have had no issues of crashing and it's one of the few apps that I really enjoy interacting with. Great job guys."", 'Constant crashing. After reading all the negative reviews, I Uninstalled it from all my devices. **Canceled subscription. App was great, until it crashed. After spending more than a hour setting it up on my Samsung tablet, it will not run. Cannot even get it to start. Too bad. In the past, my experiences have been good with this app. Guess I will see how long it takes to crash on my cell phone. So much for multi-device sync. Such a disappointment. **see above, for new comment added.', 'Tasks have become unmanageably buggy. Organizing from one colomn to another is almost impossible. The tasks keep going all the way to the bottom of the list almost every time, and won\'t respond if you press the ""completed"" circle to mark it off. Sorry. I wish this could get fixed. Otherwise the tasks become more of a hassle than productive.', 'Excellent customer service and very reasonable staff. They tried to reach me within a week, their responses were very clear and not once did they blame me for any issues I had run into. Overall, a great experience. The app itself is nice as a To-Do list or to organize your numerous tasks by due date, categories as well as location.', 'I wish there was a version that i could just buy once and not a plan. I would pay a lot just to buy the full version once and never again. Also the events are not editable if its using a Samsung account. Can you also add a button to minimise the completed tasks or archive it?; I like to keep them on the daily schedule but I dont want them shown all the time in the regular to do list.', ""Really, really nice app. It is missing some features I'd like to see. For instance, it's sort of hard to schedule your day, so it works better as a to-do list. You can do it, but it's an arduous process. However, the interface is great. You can schedule reminders, and it's worked better for me than other free apps like Trello or ToDoist."", ""I loved this app however now it doesn't connect to Alexa lists anymore"", ""1) It has a calendar feature but you can't customize the calendar events repetition as much as you can in google (can do daily but not 5 days a week all in one entry). 2) edit: figured the task sorting part out. Sort by time and collapse upcoming/tomorrow and it will just show your daily tasks. I like that. But it's still not worth paying for unless the calendar event customization is as good as Google's since that is free."", ""Initial upgrade hid the separation of today tomorrow upcoming and someday. After sorting and adding new tasks all of sudden they all showed up again. Don't know why this happened. If these features go away it will make this app much harder to use. The bug freaked me out and cause me to write a very bad review which I have since edited and amended"", ""It's good app but the calendar view doesn't highlight the day you're on. It's gray like the other days and makes it hard to quicly scroll to today's events. For task view, ,it needs to show the time the task is assigned so you can get it done. However, if you go to calendar view, it will show the task and time."", '29.9. Nothing new, I\'ve already reconciled to that ""improved"" GUI. // 16.7.20, 3.8.19: No, a long time ago I was able to create a FULL (WITH a reminder) task in a LANDSCAPE mode. It\'s impossible now (after that \'redesign\'). // 17.7., 2.3.: I\'m pretty sure I WAS ABLE to create/edit a new task in ONE go (and in LANDSCAPE). It takes MORE moves now. // 2.2.2019: I CANNOT believe that when I HAVE got to change a grip from PORTAIT to LANDSCAPE when creating / editing a task it is more effective than before...', 'Perfect app, it realy helps me to organize my plans...

Just wish there was an option for a pay-once lifetime premium membership. This is a great app, i really love it.', 'Excellent app. Works without any bugs that I\'ve found. Great way to keep on top of things. I use this for work, personal, everything. Removes stress from remembering what to do and when. I can literally throw it in the inbox and forget until my morning breakfast ""organise my day"" routine. 6 stars out of 5. Great app. üòÅüëèüëç', ""The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? The old widget could do things the app couldn't, and can't. Give it back! Matters have improved, though - it's now easy to open the app from the new widget."", ""I really like this app and how it can also run on web and synchronise smoothly. [However, I am also using a widget on my phone and that always has weird sync problems. Like: if I mark a task completed on the widget or from the app, it doesn't disappear from there, and there is no way to refresh it.] Edit: I'm no longer facing this issue at the moment, but I'll contact you in case I notice it again. Thank you for your reply!"", ""It's amazing for being free, and serves its purpose of decluttering your day to day and things to do from the simplest of tasks to the big goals you wanna reach, there is a premium mode but the free version doesn't have ads and is very intuitive, i love this app and hope it helps keep things stress free and helps remind and do the things i need and want to do. Overall amazing!"", ""This app is perfect! Simple to use and full featured. Let's you organize your ToDo's tasks into Projects, Subjects within the Project, and even sub-tasks within the tasks. Fantastic tool for logical thinkers. If you are a random thinker like my wife, she just lumps everything in one list, then uses labels to sort things out. Love that it also does Kanban board too."", ""Pushes me to do more ! I'm the kind of person who procrastinates because I feel very easily overwhelmed and it paralyses me. This app is perfect as it feels very rewarding to see all the tasks of the day being ticked away one by one ! Also allows to keep track of everything when you're a busy bee and you tend to forget what you've got to do way too easily ! Would highly recommend. 5/5"", 'Would like a list to be available, showing dates that repeating tasks were completed on. So I can see in one place all the dates I exercised on for example. That\'s the only thing I can think of to improve it! Also being able to set the list a new task automatically gets added to would be nice. I never use the inbox list because I know you can\'t see a list of completed items there. I put everything in a ""to do"" project list so completed tasks don\'t disappear with no record they ever existed!', ""After turning off *all* of the notifications, it's exactly the To Do app *I* need. Instead of sixty sheets of paper with projects I'm working on or was working on or ideas for art or groceries or whatever! I have this. I've been using it about a week, and so far, I think it's working out rather well."", 'The repeat option is nonexist. The only time its allowed me to repeat a task is ""every month"". At first I thought ""every two weeks"" might be too confusing for it but I tried ""every week"" and ""every day"" and it doesn\'t pop up except for that first day. Also the fact that it often lists the scheduled date as ""today"" despite me not yet picking a date is stupid, and it resets to ""today"" automatically when I try to edit the task in any way (like change the name). It doesn\'t make any sense!', 'I tried a bunch of the other top todo apps and like this the best. The simplicity of creating tasks and tagging tasks in natural language is great, as well as the ability to deeply customize your taxonomy with labels and sub projects. I\'d probably rate it 5 if the note taking experience was better. ""notes"" are just ""comments"", and look terrible outside of mobile. They\'re given tiny real estate on web UI. Feel like it be better if projects/tasks had a dedicated ""summary"" field.', ""I'm currently using todoist premium, and unfortunately it ain't worth it. There are lot of restrictions in free version i.e., a simple thing as reminder option (really? Any free app allows that function). Also, it doesn't have any proper calendar view like Google Calendar. The Date parsing and natural language works fine. Other than that, I didn't find anything worth buying premium and free version doesn't provide much functions. There are other apps like TickTick that's same but better. üëçüèº"", ""12/1/20 edit: All of my previous grievances have been corrected and improved upon including being able to add new tasks with due dates in the widget and having them auto-sort. Props on the improvements, keep up the good work :) March review: New update to the widget makes it so I can no longer get into the full app by tapping on the widget, I actually have to go into my list of apps or create a whole other shortcut. You tout a fully operational widget but I can't rearrange my list entries via the widget, only the full app menu (and it was already a pain to rearrange my tasks in the first place, I really really wish there was an option to add new tasks to the top of the list rather than the bottom.) I will be trying out new to-do list apps now."", 'Throw anything into the Inbox, to sort later (or right away) using Priority, Schedule (with reminders), Labels and Projects ""folders"". Set up a workflow that suits you any it\'s very helpful and simple to use!', ""I live by lists. I've used so many apps, and nothing has the functionality of Todoist - especially for free. Slight learning curve if you want to use it to full capability, but the web site teaches you. Stop looking, you won't find better."", 'I use this for GTD. On the premium version and I think the best benefit is file attachments, but the price still feels a bit high. Reminders being a premium feature is silly tho. My main gripe right is now is the difficulty in deleting completed tasks, you have to do them one at a time üôÉ', ""Love this app. I was addicted to another to do app and it was very difficult to make the switch. The final push was Todoist's excellent 2 way sync with Google calendar. This has made me significanly more productive from day one with this app. Love it!!"", ""Works amazing both on the website for my desktop and on my phone. But the new update, board view, on the app doesn't work properly. Some of the sections of my projects in board view are not being displayed but they reappear when I add a task in that section."", 'The app is kinda glitchy. My list has lots of tasks that are sub-tasks under a main task. When I press the carrot to expand/collapse a main task, it expands the list, but displays everthing twice. I have to press the carrot again for the list to display correctly.', ""Super helpful. It's easy to add tasks to any category or sub category and assign them to an individual all in one step. Helps me and my husband keep track of what needs done and how busy the other person is."", ""I've only been using this app for a few days, but am already noticing how helpful it is. I was endlessly writing lists on scrapes of paper and getting in a mess. This is really helping streamline my workflow."", ""This app is nice but I don't like it because it only works with internet and there are some options which only work if I pay money, I disliked this app only because of those problems. If this app not contain those two problems I have given it 5 star. Anyways Thank you"", 'This app has come a long way in a few years. I have used a lot of task managing apps. Todoist is clean simple and it has actually replaced my whole calendar app I was using. The free version is more than good enough for everyday life managing. Highly recommend giving it a try.', ""Took a minute to figure out the terminology, but once I did, the literal best app I have on my phone. This is only the second app I've felt strongly enough about to take a minute to write a review. It's good. You need todoist. Period."", 'Its a great app and encourages productivity. A nitpick i have with the newest update is that the ""sorted by due date"" still appears in the widget screen, and is kind of annoying. It would be nice if that is removed, thanks!', ""Makes day to day tasks easier to remember and adding to the list is easy with auto recognition of date formats and tags. I can't say enough about how helpful it's been to help me get organized and make my day calmer."", ""Great app. But I have a problem. When the phone is not working, the sound of a completed task is heard. And if I restart my phone, this problem doesn't occur until I open the app again."", ""In the last few weeks I can't see any of the font unless I put in dark mode. If I click on the name of the item it just pops up and disappears right away. I didn't see any updates but not sure what changed it's not very useful anymore. Issue resolved."", 'The app is good and user interface is simple. The thing is in free version, the projects are limited to 5 and you cant add descriptions to tasks! Tick tick give 9 projects and can add description even to sub-tasks! Would be nice if we have a merged version between them :"")', ""Sort by priority works differently now. It's only temporary and that's not what I need. If I add 10 new tasks with priority I don't want to change the order for all tasks manually."", ""I have to constantly resort the items when I add a new item in a list. It doesn't automatically sort by date. The new item gets put to the bottom. SOLVED"", 'Best ""to do list"" apo I\'ve ever seen. I tried many, and this one is the most powerful and easy to use. Important thing is that app is improving from day to day. Everything you may be dislike today, tomorrow can be fixed.', ""I think it would be more competitive if one or two of the paid for functions were free but overall it's a solid app. It functions well for how and why I use it. No complaints so far, just good vibes!"", 'Todoist is as simple as you want it to be or as complex as you need - it works great for organizing my tasks, whether they are work related or just personal things like chores', ""Only used it for 2 days but really wish I could see all the accomplished tasks that were scratch off. It's a basic to do list app and nothing more unless you pay for the premiums."", 'After almost 1 year of trying to adopt, I have given up. Repeating tasks are nice but not when they end up on the wrong days because they change during set up. App tries to do too many things.', 'The app should return to the previous version when all sub-tasks could be displayed directly on the ""today"" view (right now this is only possible on a project view)', 'Im in love with this app soo much .but one disappointment is that it is not fully free .i was ble to put only 3 projects.but daily use of this app is perfect.', 'Overall, I like the app but I think it can be easier to schedule reminders and the integration with Outlook does not work.', 'Does the job perfectly for me!

I bought the pro version and made a suggestion about the reminder sounds, in a few days they had made the change to the app! Very impressed.', 'It does everything you need to be productive.

Great app."", ""This app sucks. The devs previous app GTasks was much simpler and only a once-off payment was required for the premium key. This TickTick app is just a money making venture with subscriptions. Boo! REPLY TO DEV: Thanks. There's nothing difficult to use about the app, just dropping paid Premium support for your other app GTasks and all but forcing users to now pay a subscription to change to a different app that with functions they don't need. If you look at other GTasks reviews, I'm sure you'll find similar comments. Happy to give a positive review if the GTasks app was supported and you reply to my (and other user) questions about the Premium key issue.

Love it, use it every day. My gripe is with the social aspect, which the app pushes really hard, but its implementation is frustrating. The way to add people to your friend list is to search for their e-mail addresses, which isn't great. Why can't I search by username or referral code? I don't want to share my e-mail address in public spaces, but there doesn't seem to be any way around it. Weirdly enough, you DO get a referral code (and it's what gets shared every time I tweet about my forest), but only five people can use it, and you can only use one other person's code. Plus the code is more about getting other people to download the app than it is adding them to your friend list. The only way to add friends is to know their e-mail. The app even has an achievement where you should get 30 friends, but I don't know a fraction of that many people with whom I'd be comfortable sharing my main address, even though I know a ton of people on social media who use Forest. If I'd known of this restriction beforehand, I would have signed up with a burner address instead."", ""Like others have said this used to be great but now it lets me go onto any app I want. I followed the directions on the linked website but now there's not even a popup when I go to a blacklisted app and go back to Forest. EDIT: though the above problem was fixed, it now refused to let me exit the app without killing my tree. I paid for premium so I could text people in emergencies and I now can not access any of those apps"", ""I've been using forest for about a week or so and obviously in the past week I had very less screentime. The app in itself is really nice but it would have been better if the allow list feature was free. That's the only thing I would like to have in addition. For school work u need certain apps so those could be kept in the list. U can use other apps if the deep focus mode is not on but u know how social media is. You are bound to open them. Overall the app is really easy to use and good."", ""I really love this app, but after upgrading it to the pro version, not only I have lost most of my unlocked trees, but I have also started losing coins (3000-4000 coins) after a period of time of using the pro version, even though I didn't buy anything."", ""- No sync of 'Favorites' saved in the app. If reinstalled, every saved favorite species will be gone - No dark mode - Full of bugs, like when the host starts the room, it won't start in your device. If you disconnect in between, it'll wither the tree for everyone. - Old UI was better, as it was quick and easy to select the tags and tree species. - Limited color options for tags. - Won't notify on completion of a tree, inspite of giving all required permissions"", ""Great for focusing and stopping phone addiction. I like that you can unlock lots of different types of trees (motivation) and encouraging messages while you grow trees. Even though there are issues due to the age of my device, the support team is amazing and is trying to fix them. Don't forget to press sync in settings if you get premium (which you should) and use multiple devices. There is also a toggeable Deep Focus Mode to stop you leaving the app and snow in December."", ""I love this app because it helps me to stay focused along my study period. I need something to force to study. So, with the dead plant if I not stay focus give me some force. I don't wanna have a dead plant in my forest. Lastly is about the sound. It has prepare some noices that makes me feel not interrupted. Love it so much."", ""Enjoying the functionality so far. But I just signed up for an account (BC I couldn't buy the booster I wanted without one) and the app now syncs for every little thing I want to do!!! Please include an offline mode or a sync toggle. I only use it on my phone so everything now takes longer than it really needs to and uses up my data. Editing to add that the bottle of sunshine didn't triple my achievement reward points."", ""I was happy when I found this app years ago, then I remembered it again. It helps me personally and my studies but I didn't like how premium users only get to plant real trees :( Great marketing strategy but I hope Planting trees will be for everyone. Maybe it won't help you alot but it will help nature alot. Two dollars might be small for you but in my country it's alot. I like seeing my plants grow but thanks?"", 'Absolutely love this app. Just wish the trees were a little cheaper in coins so they were easier to get. At the moment it takes me a month to get a new one. But at least that means I have to stay committed! The app is so cute, would highly recommend to anyone, especially students. Been doing a lot more uni work since I got this!!', ""I've been using the forest app since 2017. Because of the new version update, the plants that I have bought on the old version from my collected coin can't be used now!!! Because these plants have been moved in the pro version section. This is not fair, it's really really difficult to collect all the coins on the old version forest app...... and now I want to use some of my plants for my pages, but I can't because I have to pay for the pro-version!!! Are u kidding me????"", ""Great app so far, on free version. Set up a daily reminder a month or so ago but only got it a couple times then nothing. Just checked settings and it is still selected so I should be getting them but I'm not."", ""Honestly, this app really helps students like me amidst this pandemic. The UI is user-friendly, the trees are cute and the mechanics are A-okay. I think there are still points that can be updated just like trees can have small animations, new forest landscapes and a bit of interaction with the forest. It may stray away from its purpose of focusing but the feeling of completion gives me satisfaction. Last is how free users access the types of trees. I'm sure that you don't want them to be lost."", ""Although I love the idea of this app, I sometimes don't know how long I'll work for, sometimes it takes less time than I originally planned, other times more. So I'd like it if there was also a stopwatch version where it'd count up instead as this would be super useful. The tree would wither when we switch out of the app or close it! PLEASE PLEASE CONSIDER!! üôèüèª"", ""Hi, it is really famous and nice app but you can not make account and connect it to your google play if you use free account but this service should be free because some people like me dont access to paypal or something international . And this app don't support every country. I think this is sound wierd but it is problem, please fix it. Thank you."", 'Really good one.. I would have given 5 stars, but the app gets glitchy at times and, the verification process for the exclusive tree has been going on for a very long time. On the other hand, Forest app is one of the best things i bought during this lockdown, helped me stay Productive and a bit focused. Thanks for a really good app, but please do make sure the verification ends a bit earlier. Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è', ""As a college student doing nursing school from home during Covid19, this app saved my life!!! It seems silly to be motivated by growing fake tiny trees but the satisfaction is real and you'll be proud of yourself for being a good student! I'm recommending it to all my fellow college students!!"", ""I've been using this app for 4 years and it's been very helpful to me...but i live in a country where i can't pay for your updates and i can't buy any trees now, it can't even lock my phone anymore i have to be a pro version user...it's not my fault you banned my country...i just don't understand why would update it to this useless version for someone in my position...I'm sadly uninstalling it"", ""It's quite a good app! I got my revision for my science exam done. In round about 30 minutes. But the only bad thing about it is, that I am dying for a Christmas tree but i have to pay.

Just having someone appreciating you after all the hard works you've done, this is a blessing. I really do recomend you to this app. But one problem. When I set the timer and then when I come to get it,it doesn't give me money sometimes. Please fix this"", ""It's good to have a app working for a productive human being. But it's extremely difficult to just see that the app can really easy to use and satisfy all necessity. Atleast 24 hrs acess to the pro version to be given to see the performance..."", ""Worse than it used to be. This app is less about planting trees - why I downloaded it - and has become more and more complicated with less user reward and less focus on the real trees being planted. Plus, with only premium users being able to plant trees, I feel like I'm just giving money to the developers. For what it's worth, I'd rather use an app that doesn't pretend to be doing good."", ""i first downloaded the app about a year ago and worked hard to save up coins for different trees however with the new update, you can't purchase certain trees unless you have the paid version. fine, i already have a couple. with the latest update, the trees you've previously purchased that are now in the paid version have been refunded and you can't use them anymore. really disappointed like many other users."", ""It's really good for your self. For me, it helps me a lot I learn how to manage my time and this app was so interesting just like a game you just need to grow the tree and it also has money so you can buy a new sounds or trees"", 'Hey guys, I use this app as a Pomodoro timer and find it lacks a 5 minute countdown as it is only limited to 10 mins as the minimum. If you could change that it would be perfect! Been using this app for a few years now and this has always been my gripe as I need to use another app for 5 min countdown.', ""This app is very useful for me as a student to focus and to get some work done. It costs like 1 or 2 dollars to unlock the full app. (When we waste so much money on other stuff i guess this isn't a much price to pay.) Anyways happiest thing is that I'm able to contribute to a real planting campaign through this app. I highly recommend this app. Very satisfied."", ""... I like this app so I buy the pro version, I hope the developer can create and update this app not only adding the variety of the tree but also the other aspects. Since the plant ground cannot be changed (green grass and brown soil) and the theme of the app just green I think it's kinda boring to see this all day. I suggest the new update can change the theme app and the plant ground to seasonal or fantasy place. Edit: Thanks for granting my wish, I love it!"", ""I was loving it before the update. I had worked enough to get different trees. It was a sort of motivation as well. Bur since the update. They took my already purchased trees away and now want me to pay money to get them. That's absurd. Very limited about of trees you can get without spending actual money. Gets boring"", ""Great way of being productive. I love how you can plant trees while not studying and make your forest look awesome. I downloaded this around a week ago and I already unlocked 3 trees and have more than 30 trees in my forest. This is offline too. It is awesome. I reccomend this to anyone who is preparing for exams or just studying but can't not look at their phone. P.

And Sir please bring a new feature of blocking websites in your next update.', ""the best productivity app I've used so far! it doesn't have distracting functions and I love how I can organise everything using tags. the cherry on top is the incredibly cute design!

I am currently studying for the exam which is a month later, and it helps a lot in improving my self-control!', ""It is a good app...
